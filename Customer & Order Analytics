# In this SQL, I am querying a databse with multiple tables in it to quantify the statistics of customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND product="iPhone";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.OrderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS total_revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT 
SUM(quantity),
product,
SUM(quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM  BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.febSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity>2
AND length(orderid)= 6
AND orderid <>'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
